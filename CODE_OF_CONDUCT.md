# Code of Conduct

---

Our aim is to foster a welcoming and productive environment for all contributors. To ensure this, we expect everyone participating in this project to adhere to the following guidelines:

* **Be Respectful:** Treat all community members with courtesy and kindness. This includes interactions in issues, pull requests, discussions, and any other project communication.
* **Encourage Constructive Dialogue:** Focus on productive discussions and problem-solving. Disagreements are natural, but personal attacks, insults, or demeaning language against any individual or group are unacceptable.
* **No Harassment or Discrimination:** We have a zero-tolerance policy for any behavior that promotes hatred, discrimination, or harassment based on (but not limited to) race, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, disability, or age.
* **Maintain a Professional Tone:** Keep discussions focused on the project's goals. Avoid inflammatory remarks, trolling, or any actions intended to provoke conflict. If you encounter such behavior, please **do not engage** and instead report it to the project maintainers.
* **Collaborate Positively:** Contribute to a supportive atmosphere where new ideas are welcomed and diverse perspectives are valued.
